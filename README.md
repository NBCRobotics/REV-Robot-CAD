# REV-Robot-CAD

This repository contains our CAD files and libraries. We are using GitHub only for the purpose of backing up and having a remote copy of the files. These files include REV, Matrix, and Tetrix files. We use Inventor as our modeling software.

For any other teams who happen to be seeing this, feel free to clone the files and adapt then for your own purposes!
